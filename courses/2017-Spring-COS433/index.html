	<h2> Course Description </h2>
	
	Cryptography is an ancient practice dating back almost 4000 years.  However, cryptography practiced today is very different than the cryptography 
	used as recently as a few decades ago.  For one, traditional cryptography was mostly synonymous with encryption: translating data into secret codes.  Today, however, 
	cryptography extends far beyond basic codes to encompass concepts such as authentication and integrity, and can be used to solve seemingly impossible tasks such as 
	public key encryption (exchanging secret messages without ever having met in person to share a secret key) and zero knowledge proofs (proving theorems without revealing the proof).
	<br><br>
	
	Another new feature in modern cryptography is its foundations.  Until recently, cryptography was largely an art form based on intuition and ad hoc tweaks to block vulnerabilities.  
	Modern crytpography is instead more of a science, characterized by rigorous mathematical definitions and theorems that guide the design of new systems.
	<br><br>
	
	This course is an introduction to modern cryptography, focusing on the theoretical foundations, with some attention to practical considerations.  We will cover a variety of 
	topics, including secret key and public key encryption, authentication, commitments, pseudorandom generators, and zero knowledge proofs.  
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Prerequisites:</b> Basic probability theory.  Basic complexity theory (as in COS340) recommended.  No programming knowledge is required, though there may be an occasional 
	extra credit exercise that will involve minimal programming (in a language of your choice).

	Homeworks will be assigned roughly every week.  Homework assignments will be posted on the course webpage early in the week (hopefully by
	Monday, definitely by Tuesday) and will be due the following Tuesday.  Expect there to be a homework assignment <i>due</i> every week except the first week of class, 
	midterm week, and the week following Spring Recess (for a total of 9 assignments).<br><br>
	
	<b>Format:</b> Please type up your solutions.  Please let the teaching staff know if this will be a problem.  LaTeX is strongly preferred.  Learning 
	LaTex will require a learning curve, but will pay off in the long run.  Once you are accustomed to LaTex, you will be able to typeset technical material 
	such as equations very quickly.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Submission:</b> Assignments will be due at 11:59pm on the due date of the assignment.  Please submit your solutions digitally through Blackboard.  
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Collaboration Policy:</b> You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments with other students in the class.  However, students must write up solutions individually, 
	and must not share their written solutions with classmates.  Please identify your collaborators on your homework submissions.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Formalism:</b> You must always show all of your work.  Unless otherwise stated, any cryptosystem derived in the homework assignment must analyzed for both correctness and security.  That is, you
	must <i>prove</i> both the correctness and security of the scheme.  When asked to prove a statement (correctness/security or otherwise), the proof needs to be well 
	written and rigorous.  Your proofs do not need to be overly formal, but should not contain any logical gaps or errors.  Any statements proved in lecture can be used in the 
	solutions without proof, but any other statement should be proved as a part of the solution.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Extra Credit:</b> There may be an occasional extra credit problem on the homework assignments.  You are not required to attempt these problems, and will not be 
	penalized for skipping them.<br><br>
	
	<b>Flexibility:</b> If you do not turn in an assignment, or turn in an assignment late, you will receive a zero for that assignment.  However, your <b>two</b> lowest homework 
	scores will automatically be dropped.  You do not need to tell us which homework scores you would like to drop, and you do not need to let us know if you plan on 
	not turning in an assignment &mdash; we will take care of the dropping for you.  Any extra credit problems attempted in a dropped homework will still be considered in the overall grade.
